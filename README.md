# Python course for my favorite grad students

Start with the Getting Setup section. You'll want to make sure you have VS Code installed, we'll be using that for just about everything. If you're on a MAC, the Basics of BASH will be helpful. Make sure you have GIT installed, we'll be using that to connected to GitHub to save our code.

Going forward, we'll start using the Conda package manager for Python and will abandon the MacPorts approach. Conda provides a much easier and cleaner way to manage multiple Python environments and packages.

## Getting Setup

## The Folders

### Notebooks Folder
Contains jupyter notebooks that can be opened in VSCode and used to interactively explore concepts.
